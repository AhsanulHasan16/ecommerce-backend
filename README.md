# ecommerce-backend
 This repo is for the ecommerce system assignment for IBCS-PRIMAX.

I tried my best to satisfy all the requirements from the backend with my code. I used the H2 database for easy development.
Because of the time constraint, I could not include documentation.
Also, I could not build a frontend for the system because of the short period, but I did implement the necessary configurations for frontend implementation.

I hope you will understand my situation and oblige me thereby.


Yours truly,
Md. Ahsanul Hasan.
